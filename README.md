# DAIR BoosterPack: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning and Mitigation on Amazon Linux
### Project Description
The `DAIR BoosterPack` is an advanced cybersecurity project developed by `Ameya Cloud Solutions` in collaboration with `CANARIE`. It leverages AI-powered vulnerability scanning and mitigation techniques to secure AWS Amazon-Linux-based environments. This project integrates Docker, Ansible, and Trivy tools to automate vulnerability detection and mitigation, with OpenSearch tools used for data ingestion, searching, visualization, and analysis. Designed to be a part of your cybersecurity portfolio, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to securing cloud-based infrastructures.

#### Key Features
1. Automated Vulnerability Scanning:
   - Leverage AI to prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitability and potential impact.
   - Use tools like OpenSCAP, Lynis, ClamAV and Trivy for baseline scans.
   - Integrate AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to identify unusual patterns and unknown vulnerabilities.
2. Real-Time Threat Detection:
   - Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze system logs and network traffic.
   - Use anomaly detection to flag potential zero-day vulnerabilities.
3. Patch Management:
   - Automatically apply patches based on the severity of the vulnerability.
   - Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching.
4. Mitigation Strategies:
   - Provide automated remediation for common vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated software).
   - Integrate with AWS Lambda to trigger custom mitigation scripts.
5. Reporting and Alerting:
   - Generate detailed vulnerability reports and trend analysis.
   - Set up alerting via AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) for real-time notifications.
6. CI/CD Integration:
   - Integrate with Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the scanning process as part of the deployment pipeline.
   - Ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated before code reaches production.
