# DAIR BoosterPack: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning and Mitigation on Amazon Linux
### Project Description
The `DAIR BoosterPack` is an advanced cybersecurity project developed by `CANARIE`. It leverages AI-powered vulnerability scanning and mitigation techniques to secure AWS Amazon-Linux-based environments. This project integrates Docker, Ansible, and Trivy tools to automate vulnerability detection and mitigation with OpenSearch tools for data ingestion, searching, visualization, and analysis.

#### Key Features
1. Automated Vulnerability Scanning:
   - Leverage AI to prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitability and potential impact.
   - Use tools like OpenSCAP, Lynis, ClamAV and Trivy for baseline scans.
   - Integrate AI models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to identify unusual patterns and unknown vulnerabilities.
2. Real-Time Threat Detection:
   - Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze system logs and network traffic.
   - Use anomaly detection to flag potential zero-day vulnerabilities.
3. Patch Management:
   - Patches are automatically applied based on the severity of the vulnerability.
   - Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching.
4. Mitigation Strategies:
   - Provide automated remediation for common vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated software).
   - Integrate with AWS Lambda to trigger custom mitigation scripts.
5. Reporting and Alerting:
   - Generate detailed vulnerability reports and trend analysis.
   - Set up alerting via AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) for real-time notifications.
6. CI/CD Integration:
   - Integrate with Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the scanning process as part of the deployment pipeline.
   - Ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated before the code reaches production.

### Getting Started
1. Prerequisites:
   - AWS Account: Necessary for setting up the Amazon-Linux-based environment.
   - Python 3.x, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Boto3.
   - Tools: OpenSCAP, Lynis, ClamAV
   - Docker: To run containerized services for scanning and mitigation.
   - Ansible: Required for automation of deployment and configuration tasks.
   - OpenSearch: For ingesting, searching, and visualizing the vulnerability data.
2. Installation:
   - Set up the AWS Amazon-Linux Environment: Configure an AWS EC2 instance with Amazon-Linux.
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-vulnerability-scanner.git`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Install Docker: Follow Docker's installation guide for your instance.
   - Install Ansible: Use the package manager to install Ansible on your instance.
   - Deploy Trivy: Install Trivy within Docker to begin scanning containers for vulnerabilities.
   - Configure OpenSearch: Set up OpenSearch for data ingestion and visualization.
3. Usage:
   - Run the initial vulnerability scan:
     `bash scripts/scan.sh`
   - Trigger AI-powered analysis:
     `python models/anomaly_detection.py`
   - Apply patches:
     `bash scripts/patch_management.sh`
   - View reports: `Open reports/latest_report.html` in your browser.
  
### Future Enhancements
- AI Model Improvements: Enhance the accuracy of the AI models by incorporating more training data.
- Docker Integration: Containerize the solution for easier deployment across environments.
- Support for Other Linux Distributions: Extend support to Ubuntu, CentOS, and others.
- Enhanced Reporting: Develop a web interface for real-time monitoring and reporting.
